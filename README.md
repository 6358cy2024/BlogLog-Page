The point of this project is to create a webpage using Web API's and have interactive user elements

This challenge is to show that I can create a webpage that has username login, JSON arrays
Have a button that can change the view of the screen to a light mode/dark mode.
Once I submit an entry, I will be able to go back to return to the initial page. //window.location.html
