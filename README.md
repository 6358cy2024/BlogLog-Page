The point of this project is to create a webpage using Web API's and have interactive user elements

This challenge is to show that I can create a webpage that has username login, JSON arrays
Have a button that can change the view of the screen to a light mode/dark mode.
Once I submit an entry, I will be able to go back to return to the initial page.

The blog that is typed out in the homepage with the author title, the title of the blog, and its contents will be
visible on the next page. This is all stored in localStorage.

There will be a footer with a link to my portfolio from before.
